## Deployment Instructions

This project is built with React and Vite. To deploy it to your web hosting:

1.  **Install Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your computer.
2.  **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` in the project root directory.
3.  **Build**: Run `npm run build`. This will generate a `dist` folder.
4.  **Upload**: Upload the contents of the `dist` folder to your web server (e.g., public_html).

Note: This app uses `localStorage` for data persistence. In a real-world scenario, you would connect this to a backend database.
